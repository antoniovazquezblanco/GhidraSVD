# Ghidra SVD

[![Build](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco/GhidraSVD/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco/GhidraSVD/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Import CMSIS SVD information onto your Ghidra memory map. This is usefull when reversing firmware from devices that publish SVD files. This is a re-write of another [Ghidra SVD Loader](https://github.com/leveldown-security/SVD-Loader-Ghidra) plugin.

This is the preferred way to generate memory maps, but if no SVD files are available for your device you may want to try the [Ghidra DeviceTreeBlob plugin](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco/GhidraDeviceTreeBlob).

## Installing

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/antoniovazquezblanco/GhidraSVD/releases) and download the latest version for your Ghidra distribution.

In Ghidra main window go to `File` > `Install extensions...`. In the new window press the `+` icon to import the downloaded zip.


## Usage

In a CodeBrowser window press `File` > `Import SVD...`.

A file dialog will allow you to select your SVD file and import it. Memory map will automatically be updated.

You may find SVD file sources in the following table:
